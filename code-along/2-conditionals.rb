puts 3 == 2  #Equal	Returns true if the operands are equal.

# #The Thing You'll Get Wrong 99 Times Until You Finally Get It Right
# The single equals sign (=) is used for variable assignment.  The double equals sign (==) is used for comparing equality.  Don't confuse the two!  Consider the following code:
# dinner = "kale"
      
# # incorrect - will cause unexpected results!
# if dinner = "tacos"
#   # This will always be true. The variable's value is reassigned.
# end
      
# # correct
# if dinner == "tacos"
#   # This will properly perform the comparison
# end
# The code in the first example dinner = "tacos" will always be true. Why? Because we're not performing a comparison; instead we're assigning the value of "tacos" to the variable dinner â€“ and this will always successfully complete.
